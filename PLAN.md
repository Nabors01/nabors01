# Write Your Plan Here

Write a paragraph or two (150+ words) about the argument you plan to make with your data, and how you plan to make it. You should continue the format the data is stored in, and how you plan to visualize it in Vpython. You can do a bar chart like the one in the demo, but you should go above and beyond the demo in your execution (think about animation, supporting text, supporting images, etc.). You can also do something else than a bar chart. See some examples of creative but clear data visualizations here.
